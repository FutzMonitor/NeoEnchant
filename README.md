The official Technical Enchant+ update
Welcome to  NeoEnchant is the official update of TE+ This project introduces a new suite of enchantments that expand upon the gameplay mechanics introduced in the previous update, V4. Explore innovative ways to enhance your Minecraft experience with our latest version, V5.
This project is the continuation of the updates introduced in Version 4. Version 5 brings new levels of gameplay enhancements and enchantments that provide both utility and fun in your Minecraft world.

# What news ?
This new version now uses Minecraft's internal system (Data Driven Enchantments), the entire pack was rewritten.
What does this mean ?  
- To put it simply, enchantments are available natively in the enchantment table. And the anvil works perfectly too.
- Performance is identical to that of a Minecraft mod, or a native Mojang production. It uses almost exclusively the new internal systems introduce in 24w18a, with only 4 enchantments using "mcfunctions" files.
- Enchantments are easy to modulate, you can edit maximum levels, items supported and even effects. No need for development knowledge. That's why I've decided to remove the management admins panel.
- Support for other mods (Forge/Fabric) or Vanilla Datapacks that add enchantments.
- In the case of enchantment modification or deletion, all enchantments will be correctly disenchanted, whether they are in chests or inventories or anywhere.
- Enchantments can be obtained from the creative menu, or with the /enchant command. 

Some bugs, errors or problems may occur.

## Minecraft Realms - Problem
Experimental features, including enchantments, are not supported by Realms.
In addition, a bug exists in Realms that makes it impossible for mcfunctions to work.
To put it simply, the custom enchantments in this pack, or any other datapack adding enchantments, don't work on Realms.
